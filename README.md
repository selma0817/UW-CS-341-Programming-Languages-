## This is a public repo for my homework solution and study materials for CS 341 Programming Languages from University of Washington. 

### Part A:
1. Basic syntax of SML, recursion, scope, variable, tuples, list (HW1)
2. Datatypes, pattern-matching, tail recursion (HW2)
3. First Class functions, closures (HW3)
4. Type Inference, modules, equivalence (Exam1)

### Part B:
1. Dynamic types, parentheses, delayed evaluation, stream, macros (HW4)
2. structs, interpreter, closures (HW5)
3. static checking, static v.s. dynamic checker. weakly typed v.s. strongly typed (Quiz1)
   


### Part C:
1. Dynamically-typed Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby (HW6)
2. OOP vs. Functional decomposition, multiple inheritance, mixins, ... (HW7)
3. Subtyping; generics vs. subtyping (Exam2)
